# TheMastermindGame
The player should guess the pattern within eight turns in both order and color.

The player should guess the letters in the generated code. Each of six letter ['R', 'Y', 'G', 'B', 'I', 'V'] in the code represents one of six colors: red ('R'), yellow ('Y'), green ('G'), blue ('B'), indigo ('I'), or violet ('V'). After each guess, the game provides the player with two numbers:
The number of letters is both the correct color and in the correct position.
The number of letters is the correct color but in the wrong position.
The player can continue to submit guesses and receive feedback until the player correctly guesses the code. 
The game aims to guess the code in the least number of guesses.
The limit of the maximum number of guesses is 8.
